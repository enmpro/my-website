                <p>
                    Hello, I am currently studying Computer Programming and Information Systems and enjoy creating projects in 
                    languages like Python and C++.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up, I was constantly exposed to technology; from experiencing sidekick phones, to playing on
                    gaming consoles, making videos with cameras, and using computers for school purposes or creating 
                    videos; my first real exposure to creating with using software was using Webs to create a website 
                    for my small for fun YouTube channel; this experience led to me wondering if websites
                    were made the same way or by other means, and by extension I thought about how technologies like
                    cameras and computers were created and what kind of software and parts they used to run.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time I got to the 10th grade, I started the process of finally getting my own computer; I had 
                    the parts purchased by my parents and built my own computer, which helped my garner more of a love
                    for how technology functions and works, even if it was just a basic understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    I took programming electives that next year, finally getting a taste of programming with True BASIC;
                    I learned algorithms and simple logic that helped me in my next elective for the year after that,
                    Programming with Java; this was my first true challenge in programming, as Java isn't an easy
                    to slide into; I was able to complete the course with high marks which ignited my passion for coding
                    and programming.
                    <br><br>
                    Continuing my programming studies in college, I also take the time to program on my own; learning 
                    languages like Python so that I can do Data Science, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I could 
                    finally create websites instead of using third-party building software like Webs.

                        <p>This project was made as a template for others to use during a hackathon hosted by 
                            a coding club I was apart of at Farmingdale State College; this project helped me 
                            gain more experience in HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.
